# Vertx Demo Samples

This is a simple Vertx Demo project created by me at Demo
Eclipse Camp in Zurich. This is not meant for production use!

## Running the project

The Demo can simply be run using the vertx plugin:

```
$ export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:PermGenSpace=200m"
$ mvn vertx:package
$ mvn vertx:run
```
